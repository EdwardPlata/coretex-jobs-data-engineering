--- Template description ---

Downstream analysis provides most information about the sequences.
There are two kinds of downstream analysis:
    - Alpha diversity
    - Beta diversity

Alpha diversity provides a detailed information about which bacteria are contained inside a single sample.
Beta diversity provides a detailed information about regional and local diversity between samples.

Input data is:
    - File which contains metadata about samples
    - Filtered sequence data generated by the second task in
      the Coretex Qiime pipeline, DADA2
    - Rooted sequence tree generated by the sixth task in the
      Coretex Qiime pipeline, Phylogenetic Diversity Analysis

Output data is:
    - Shannon’s diversity index - quantitative measure of community richness
    - Observed Features - qualitative measure of community richness
    - Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity  - qualitative measure of community
      richness that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features
    - Evenness (Pielou’s Evenness) - measure of community evenness
    - Jaccard distance - qualitative measure of community dissimilarity
    - Bray-Curtis distance - quantitative measure of community dissimilarity
    - unweighted UniFrac distance - qualitative measure of community
      dissimilarity that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features
    - weighted UniFrac distance - quantitative measure of community dissimilarity
      that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features

--- Template parameters description ---

--- dataset description ---
A dataset which contains phylogenetic tree. This
dataset is output of the "Step #6" template. Dataset is generated
by Qiime2 tool.
---------------------------

--- importedDataset description ---
A dataset which contains demultiplexed fastq sequences. This
dataset is output of the "Step #1" template. Dataset is generated
by Qiime2 tool.
-----------------------------------

--- denoisedDataset description ---
A dataset which contains denoised fastq sequences. This
dataset is output of the "Step #3" template. Dataset is generated
by Qiime2 tool.
-----------------------------------

--- samplingDepth description ---
Threshold for sequence counts. Any sequence which has less sequence
counts than this value will be dropped from processing.
---------------------------------

--- maxDepth description ---
Maximum depth of sequence counts for which the rarefied tables
will be generated. If any of the sequences have higher depth/sequence
count then rarefied tables will not be generated.
----------------------------

--- targetTypeColumn description ---
The column in the metadata file that will be used for diversity analysis.
