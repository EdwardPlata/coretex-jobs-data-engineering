--- Template description ---

This job uses vsearch to perform OTU clustering with the de novo method.

OTU stands for "Operational Taxonomic Unit." OTU clustering involves grouping
similar DNA or RNA sequences together based on a predefined sequence similarity
threshold. The similarity threshold is typically set at a certain percentage (e.g., 97%)
of sequence identity. Sequences that share this level of
similarity are grouped into the same OTU.

The input is the dataset created by the third job in the Coretex Qiime Pipeline,
DADA2. What gets used for the clustering is the feature table.

The output is a BIOM file with OTUs.

--- percentIdentity description ---
In OTU clustering, sequences that share a certain level of sequence identity are
considered to be part of the same taxonomic unit. This similarity threshold,
often expressed as a percentage, determines how closely related sequences need
to be in order to be grouped together. For example, if the percent identity
threshold is set at 97%, it means that sequences with at least 97% identical
bases are clustered into the same OTU.
