--- Template description ---

Demultiplexing sequences job template is based on Qiime2 Moving Pictures
tutorial (https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.2/tutorials/moving-pictures/#demultiplexing-sequences).
Qiime2 is a software tool used for processing BioInformatics sequences.

Multiple samples can be pooled into a single sequencing run. This reduces the time and
cost of sequencing. To differentiate between these samples, each of them had a unique
barcode injected into them before sequencing them.

Before doing any kind of analysis on sequence data, you first need to extract
the sample data from sequences associated with every of the barcodes. This template
is used for doing that.

The input is a dataset which contains miltiplexed sequences imported to Qiime2
with the EMP Protocol. This can be done using the Import job form the Coretex
Qiime templates

Output data is demultiplexed sequences which contains a separate "fastq" file
for every sample.

--- barcodeColumn description ---
Column from sequence metadata file which containes IDs for samples.
The values of this column are used to match sample sequences with their
corresponding barcode.
