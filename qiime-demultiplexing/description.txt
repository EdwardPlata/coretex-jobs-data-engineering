--- Template description ---

Demultiplexing sequences project template is based on Qiime2 Moving Pictures
tutorial (https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.2/tutorials/moving-pictures/#demultiplexing-sequences).
Qiime2 is a software tool used for processing BioInformatics sequences.

Sequences may contain multiple samples inside them. This was done so multiple samples could be
sequenced together. To differentiate between these samples, each of them had a unique
barcode injected into them before sequencing them.

Before doing any kind of analysis on sequence data, you first need to extract
the sample data from sequences associated with every of the barcodes. This template
is used for doing that, and for this reason it is marked as "Step #1".

Input data can be multiplexed sequences in "fastq" format, alongside
their barcodes which are also represented in "fastq", and a third file which contains
information about samples (sample ID, and metadata about samples) in "csv" format.

Output data is demultiplexed sequences which contains a separate "fastq" file
for every sample.

In case your data is already demultiplexed this template can be used to import that data
into the coretex bioinformatics pipeline, and make it compatible with the templates
that follow this one.

--- Template parameters description ---

--- dataset description ---
A dataset which contains multiplexed or demultiplexed fastq sequences.
Dataset format must match this structure in case of multiplexed data:
    - sequences (folder)
        - sequences.fastq
        - barcodes.fastq
    - Sequence metadata file: expected format is tsv (tab seperated values)
Dataset format must macth this sturcture in case of demultiplexed data:
    1 Sample:
        - Sequence metadata file: expected format is tsv
    N Samples:
        - {forward_sequence}.fastq
        - Optional: {reverse_sequence}.fstq
---------------------------

--- metadataFileName description ---
Name of the sequence metadata file from the dataset.
------------------------------------

--- barcodeColumn description ---
(If this field is empty it will be assumed that the sequencing reads are demultiplexed)
Column from sequence metadata file which containes IDs for samples.
The values of this column are used to match sample sequences with their
corresponding barcode. Only used with multiplexed data.
