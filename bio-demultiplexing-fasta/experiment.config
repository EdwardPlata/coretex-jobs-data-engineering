    "description": "Demultiplexing sequences project template is based on Qiime2 Moving Pictures\r\ntutorial (https:\/\/docs.qiime2.org\/2023.2\/tutorials\/moving-pictures\/#demultiplexing-sequences).\r\nQiime2 is a software tool used for processing BioInformatics sequences.\r\n\r\nSequences may contain multiple samples inside them. This was done so multiple samples could be\r\nsequenced together. To differentiate between these samples, each of them had a unique\r\nbarcode injected into them before sequencing them.\r\n\r\nBefore doing any kind of analysis on sequence data, you first need to extract\r\nthe sample data from sequences associated with every of the barcodes. This template\r\nis used for doing that, and for this reason it is marked as \"Step #1\".\r\n\r\nInput data can be multiplexed sequences in \"fastq\" format, alongside\r\ntheir barcodes which are also represented in \"fastq\", and a third file which contains\r\ninformation about samples (sample ID, and metadata about samples) in \"csv\" format.\r\n\r\nOutput data is demultiplexed sequences which contains a separate \"fastq\" file\r\nfor every sample.\r\n\r\nIn case your data is already demultiplexed this template can be used to import that data\r\ninto the coretex bioinformatics pipeline, and make it compatible with the templates\r\nthat follow this one.\r\n",
