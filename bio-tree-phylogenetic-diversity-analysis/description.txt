--- Template description ---

Phylogenetic diversity analysis project template is based on Qiime2 Moving Pictures
tutorial (https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.2/tutorials/moving-pictures/#generate-a-tree-for-phylogenetic-diversity-analyses).
Qiime2 is a software tool used for processing BioInformatics sequences.

To do downstream analysis you first need to generate a phylogenetic tree representation
of sequences contained in the data generated by the previous step ("Step #2"). This will
create a tree representation of all data samples contained inside the sequence.

Input data is filtered sequence data generated by the previous step.
Output data is:
    - Aligned sequence data
    - Masked aligned sequence data
    - Unrooted sequence tree
    - Rooted sequence tree

--- dataset description ---
A dataset which contains denoised fastq sequences. This
dataset is output of the "Step #2" template. Dataset is generated
by Qiime2 tool.
