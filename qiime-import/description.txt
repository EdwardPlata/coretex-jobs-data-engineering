--- Template description ---

This task imports sequencing reads into a Qiime2 format so that, further downstream, they
could be processed and analysed by using other tasks that are part of the Coretex Qiime pipeline.

Both multiplexed and demultiplexed sequencing reads, as well as both single-end and paired-end
sequencing reads are supported. Only sequences with quality, a.k.a. fastq, files can be
imported with this task.

In the case you want to import multiplexed data, you will need it in the "EMP protocol",
about which you can learn more here: http://earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/.
The input should be one "forward.fastq" file with your sequences (or only forward sequences in
case you are importing paired-end reads), one "barcodes.fastq" which will have the
barcodes for each read in the file, and optionally, in case of paired-end reads, a
"reverse.fastq" with the reverse sequences.

In addition to these two to three files, you also need a metadata file in either tsv or
csv format. The metadata should follow the qiime2 standards which can be found here:
https://gregcaporaso.github.io/q2book/using/metadata.html

All your data can be uploaded as a single zip file / Coretex sample, or you may
choose to upload multiple, in which case each of them must follow the same protocol as
described above.

In the case you want to import demultiplexed data, you will need to have each sample
as a separate Coretex sample with either one (single-end) or two (paired-end) fastq files.
In addition, a "_metadata" Coretex sample is required that will hold the metadata file.
In case you are using sequencing reads generated by an Illumina sequencing machine,
you can automatically import them in the needed format by using the "Illumina dataset"
option when creating a Coretex dataset in a bioinformatics space.

--- Template parameters description ---

--- dataset description ---
A dataset which contains multiplexed or demultiplexed fastq sequences.
Dataset format must match this structure in case of multiplexed data:
    - forward.fastq
    - Optional: reverse.fastq
    - barcodes.fastq
    - Sequence metadata file: expected format is tsv or csv (tab/comma seperated values)
Dataset format must macth this sturcture in case of demultiplexed data:
    1 Sample (_metadata):
        - Sequence metadata file: expected format is tsv or csv
    N Samples:
        - {forward_sequence}.fastq
        - Optional: {reverse_sequence}.fstq
---------------------------

--- metadataFileName description ---
Name of the sequence metadata file from the dataset. The file has to follow the QIIME2
standard for metadata files: https://gregcaporaso.github.io/q2book/using/metadata.html
