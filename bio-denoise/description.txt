--- Template description ---

Sequence quality control and feature table construction project template is based on Qiime2 Moving Pictures
tutorial (https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.2/tutorials/moving-pictures/#sequence-quality-control-and-feature-table-construction).
Qiime2 is a software tool used for processing BioInformatics sequences.

Demultiplexed samples contain some errors in the sequence so a correction algorithm needs to
be applied to cleanup the data. These algorithms are currently supported:
    - DADA2
    - Deblur

Input data is demultiplexed sequences in "fastq" format which are generated
by running the project template marked as "Step #1".

Output data is filtered sequence data, as well as feature table which was
constructed based on the filtered sequence data.

--- Template parameters description ---

--- dataset description ---
A dataset which contains demultiplexed fastq sequences. This
dataset is output of the "Step #1" template. Dataset is generated
by Qiime2 tool.
---------------------------

--- barcodesFileName description ---
Name of the sequence metadata file from the dataset.
------------------------------------

--- algorithm description ---
Algorithm used for denoising demultiplexed sequences.
Supported values are:
   - DADA2

Coming soon:
   - Deblur
-----------------------------

--- trimLeftF description ---
Amount of bases to be trimmed from the start of the forward sequence.
This value is determined based on the "Quality Plots" which are
generated by the "Step #1" template. The plot can be found in
"demux.qzv" file.
----------------------------

--- trimLeftR description ---
Amount of bases to be trimmed from the start of the reverse sequence.
This value is determined based on the "Quality Plots" which are
generated by the "Step #1" template. The plot can be found in
"demux.qzv" file.
----------------------------

--- truncLenF description ---
(If this field is empty, the value will be determined automatically)
Position at which the forward sequence will be truncated. This allows user
to remove low quality regions of the sequences.
This value is determined based on the "Quality Plots" which are
generated by the "Step #1" template. The plot can be found in
"demux.qzv" file.
