--- Template description ---

To do downstream analysis you first need to generate a phylogenetic tree representation
of sequences contained in the data generated by the previous step ("Step #2"). This will
create a tree representation of all data samples contained inside the sequence.

Input data is filtered sequence data generated by the previous step.
Output data is:
    - Aligned sequence data
    - Masked aligned sequence data
    - Unrooted sequence tree
    - Rooted sequence tree

--- dataset description ---
A dataset which contains denoised fastq sequences. This
dataset is output of the second task in the Coretex Qiime pipeline,
DADA2, and the files within it are generated by using Qiime2
