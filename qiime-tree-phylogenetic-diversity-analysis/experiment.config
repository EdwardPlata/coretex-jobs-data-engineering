This will\r\ncreate a tree representation of all data samples contained inside the sequence.\r\n\r\nInput data is filtered sequence data generated by the previous step.\r\nOutput data is:\r\n    - Aligned sequence data\r\n    - Masked aligned sequence data\r\n    - Unrooted sequence tree\r\n    - Rooted sequence tree\r\n",
