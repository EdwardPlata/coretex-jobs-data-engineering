This is important\nbecause sequencing errors are common, and distinguishing true biological\nvariation from sequencing errors is crucial for accurate downstream analysis.\n\nRead Pair Assembly: DADA2 works with paired-end sequencing data and assembles\nthe forward and reverse reads into full-length sequences. This step helps\nto capture the complete biological sequences and increases accuracy.\n\nError Correction: By using the estimated error rates, DADA2 identifies\nand corrects sequencing errors. Instead of clustering sequences into\nOTUs, DADA2 seeks to resolve each unique biological sequence variant\n(often referred to as amplicon sequence variants or ASVs) and their\nabundances directly from the raw data.\n\nChimera Detection: DADA2 employs a statistical approach to identify\nand remove chimera sequences, which are artifacts created during\nPCR amplification. This is another critical step to ensure that\nonly genuine biological sequences are retained.\n\nResults: The output of DADA2's denoising process is a table\nthat contains the identified sequence variants along with\ntheir respective abundances in each sample.
