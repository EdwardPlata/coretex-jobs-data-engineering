These algorithms are currently supported:\r\n    - DADA2\r\n    - Deblur\r\n\r\nInput data is demultiplexed sequences in \"fastq\" format which are generated\r\nby running the project template marked as \"Step #1\".\r\n\r\nOutput data is filtered sequence data, as well as feature table which was\r\nconstructed based on the filtered sequence data.\r\n",
