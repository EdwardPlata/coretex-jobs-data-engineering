--- Template description ---

This task uses DADA2 to perform donoising, error correction and other DADA2
functions.

Input data are demultiplexed sequences in "fastq" format which should have been
imported with the first job of the Coretex Qiime pipeline (Import) or demultiplexed
in the second (Demultiplexing sequences).

The following will be performed by DADA2:

Error Modeling and Quality Filtering: DADA2 begins by estimating the error rates
of each sequencing run and filtering out low-quality reads. This is important
because sequencing errors are common, and distinguishing true biological
variation from sequencing errors is crucial for accurate downstream analysis.

Read Pair Assembly: DADA2 works with paired-end sequencing data and assembles
the forward and reverse reads into full-length sequences. This step helps
to capture the complete biological sequences and increases accuracy.

Error Correction: By using the estimated error rates, DADA2 identifies
and corrects sequencing errors. Instead of clustering sequences into
OTUs, DADA2 seeks to resolve each unique biological sequence variant
(often referred to as amplicon sequence variants or ASVs) and their
abundances directly from the raw data.

Chimera Detection: DADA2 employs a statistical approach to identify
and remove chimera sequences, which are artifacts created during
PCR amplification. This is another critical step to ensure that
only genuine biological sequences are retained.

Results: The output of DADA2's denoising process is a table
that contains the identified sequence variants along with
their respective abundances in each sample. This table can
then be used for downstream analyses, such as taxonomic classification,
diversity analysis, and more.

--- dataset description ---
A dataset which contains demultiplexed fastq sequences which
have been imported into Qiime2.

--- trimLeftF description ---
Amount of bases to be trimmed from the start of the forward sequence.
This value is determined based on the "Quality Plots" which are
generated by the "Step #1" template. The plot can be found in
"demux.qzv" file.

--- trimLeftR description ---
Amount of bases to be trimmed from the start of the reverse sequence.
This value is determined based on the "Quality Plots" which are
generated by the "Step #1" template. The plot can be found in
"demux.qzv" file.

--- truncLenF description ---
(If this field is empty, the value will be determined automatically)
Position at which the forward sequence will be truncated. This allows user
to remove low quality regions of the sequences.
This value is determined based on the "Quality Plots" which are
generated by the "Step #1" template. The plot can be found in
"demux.qzv" file.
