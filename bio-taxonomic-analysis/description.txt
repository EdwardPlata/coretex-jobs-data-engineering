--- Template description ---

Taxonomic Analysis project template is based on Qiime2 Moving Pictures
tutorial (https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.2/tutorials/moving-pictures/#taxonomic-analysis).
Qiime2 is a software tool used for processing BioInformatics sequences.

Taxonomic analysis is used to extract taxonomy (taxonomic composition) of
the samples. It achieves this by using a ML model for this process.

The info that gets extracted is also visualized, so you
can easily explore multiple levels of taxonomic composition of the samples.

Input data is:
    - File which contains metadata about samples
    - ML model which predicts taxonomic composition of a
      given sequence
    - Filtered sequence data generated by "Step #2"

Output data is the taxonomic composition of the provided samples.

--- Template parameters description ---

--- dataset description ---
A dataset which contains denoised fastq sequences. This
dataset is output of the "Step #2" template. Dataset is generated
by Qiime2 tool.
---------------------------

--- importedDataset description ---
A dataset which contains demultiplexed fastq sequences. This
dataset is output of the "Step #1" template. Dataset is generated
by Qiime2 tool.

--- barcodesFileName description ---
Name of the sequence metadata file from the dataset.
------------------------------------

--- classifier description ---
Classifier which will be used to perform taxonomic analysis
on the provided data.
